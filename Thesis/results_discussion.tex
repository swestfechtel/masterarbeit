\section{Comparison of Social Network Analysis across regions}
\label{sec:res_sna}

\subsection{One-way ANOVAs for network statistics}
\label{sec:sna_anovas}

One of the goals of this work is to investigate whether there are significant differences between the different datasets in terms of network statistics. This knowledge might be used e.g. to the impact of different containment methods. One-way ANOVAs with multiple comparisons were used to identify significant differences between the networks derived from the datasets. Furthermore, descriptive statistics are given for all computed network statistics.

\paragraph{Degree centrality} Recall that degree centrality values are normalised; therefore comparison values derived from original publications are adjusted accordingly. Average values for the different regions were $0.0071\pm0.016$ for the Yunnan dataset ($1.345\pm3.187$ reported in the original publication \cite{hainan_publication}; $0.0079\pm0.018$ adjusted for normalisation), $0.0093\pm0.011$ for the Hainan dataset ($1.51\pm1.79$ reported in the original publication \cite{hainan_publication}; $0.0093\pm0.011$ adjusted for normalisation), $0.0043\pm0.0056$ for the Shaanxi dataset ($0.987\pm1.351$ reported in the original publication \cite{shaanxi_publication}; $0.0041\pm0.0057$ adjusted for normalisation), $0.00036\pm0.00067$ for the Xi'an dataset ($0.741\pm1.379$ in the original publication \cite{xian_publication}; $0.00036\pm0.00067$ adjusted for normalisation), $1.80e^{-5}\pm6.84e^{-5}$ for the China dataset (no data reported in the original publication), and $7.9e^{-6}\pm1.4e^{-5}$ for the Bucharest dataset (no data reported in the original publication). Therefore, values could reliably be reproduced where applicable, assuming some loss of precision.

One-way ANOVA comparison between the regions found a significant difference between the means ($F(5,86327) = 6265; \: p<0.0001$). Compared against each other (using Tukey's multiple comparisons test with 95\% confidence interval), all regions were pairwise significantly different except Bucharest vs. China ($p=0.6956$).

\paragraph{Betweenness centrality} Average values for the different regions were $7.32e^{-6}\pm3.67e^{-5}$ for the Yunnan dataset ($0.0000\pm0.0000$ reported in the original publication \cite{hainan_publication}), $1.72e^{-5}\pm1.09e^{-4}$ for the Hainan dataset ($0.0000\pm0.0001$ reported in the original publication \cite{hainan_publication}), $1.68e^{-5}\pm1.02e^{-4}$ for the Shaanxi dataset ($0.0000\pm0.0001$ reported in the original publication \cite{shaanxi_publication}), $1.60e^{-6}\pm2.41e^{-5}$ for the Xi'an dataset (no data reported in the original publication), $5.18e^{-5}\pm0.01$ for the Bucharest dataset (no data reported in the original publication), and $2.33e^{-8}\pm9.05e^{-7}$ for the China dataset (no data reported in the original publication). Taking into account that values only include four digits after the decimal point and the resulting loss of information, values could reliably be reproduced where applicable.

All other pairs were significantly different.

No values were reported in the original publications, only individual clusters were examined in an exploratory fashion in \cite{hainan_publication,shaanxi_publication,xian_publication}.

One-way ANOVA comparison between the regions found a significant difference between the means ($F(5,86326) = 192.3; \: p<0.0001$).

\paragraph{Average shortest path length} Average values for the different regions were $0.25\pm0.39$ for the Yunnan dataset, $0.45\pm0.47$ for the Hainan dataset, $0.52\pm0.56$ for the Shaanxi dataset, $0.61\pm0.80$ for the Xi'an dataset, $0.32\pm0.51$ for the Bucharest dataset, and $0.24\pm0.67$ for the China dataset. Shortest path length was not analysed in any of the previous works, therefore there are no comparison values.

One-way ANOVA comparison between the regions found a significant difference between the means ($F(5,86326)=196.8; \: p<0.0001$). Compared against each other (Tukey's test, 95\% CI), results were mixed. There was no significant difference for Yunnan vs. Bucharest ($p=0.5994$), Yunnan vs. China ($p>0.9999$), Hainan vs. Shaanxi ($p=0.8659$), and Shaanxi vs Xi'an ($p=0.2042$). All other pairs were significantly different.

\subsection{Regression models for contact nomination likelihood}
\label{sec:sna_regression}

As briefly stated in chapter \ref{ch:methods}, ordinary least-squares regression was subsequently used to determine the influence of network statistics and actor covariates on contact nomination likelihood. To this end, for each dataset, all possible actor combinations were compiled into a dataset; each record contains network statistics and actor covariates of the source and target, and the absolute difference between source and target values for each variable. The regression model is fitted on the complete dataset, conditioned on whether there is a contact nomination seen in the actual underlying data (i.e. the original data presented in chapter \ref{ch:previous_work_data}). Therefore, the focus lies on explaining rather than predicting contact nominations. As covariates differ between the datasets, a different model was created for each dataset. The Xi'an dataset was excluded from this analysis, as it unfortunately does not include patient covariates.

\paragraph{Yunnan network} With a 95\% confidence interval, the statistically significant predictors for contact nomination likelihood are the sex of the nominator ($p<0.001$), sex discrepancy between nominator and nominee ($p<0.001$), whether the nominator is a family member of another actor in the dataset ($p<0.001$), and all network statistics for nominator, nominee, and the difference between nominator and nominee, with the exception of the average shortest path length of the nominator ($p=0.224$). Nominator sex has a marginally positive effect on contact nomination likelihood (coefficient = 0.0036); sex discrepancy has a marginally positive effect (coefficient = 0.0033); family member status of the nominator has a marginally positive effect (coefficient = 0.0036); degree centrality of nominator and nominee both have a slightly positive effect (coefficients = 0.0874 and 0.0901), while degree centrality discrepancy has a slightly negative effect (coefficient = -0.0880); betweenness centrality of nominator and nominee both have a slightly negative effect (covariates = -0.0103 and -0.0114), while betweenness centrality discrepancy has a slightly positive effect (coefficient = 0.0182); pagerank centrality of the nominator has a slightly negative effect, the pagerank centrality of the nominee has a slightly positive effect, and pagerank centrality discrepancy has a slightly negative effect (coefficients = -0.0182, 0.172, and -0.0193, respectively); the component size of the nominator has a slightly negative effect, the component size of the nominee has a slightly positive effect, and component size discrepancy has a slightly negative effect (coefficients = -0.0350, 0.1101, and -0.1140, respectively); finally, the average shortest path length of the nominator has a marginally positive effect, the average shortest path length of the nominee has a slightly negative effect, and average shortest path length discrepancy has a slightly positive effect on contact nomination likelihood (coefficients = 0.0024, -0.0665, and 0.0702, respectively).
