All acquired datasets were preprocessed and transformed into suitable formats using \emph{Python} \cite{python} and \emph{pandas} \cite{pandas} software. Social network analysis was performed using \emph{networkx} \cite{networkx} and \emph{statsmodels} \cite{seabold2010statsmodels}, and REM and RHEM results were produced using the \emph{eventnet} \cite{eventnet_rem,eventnet_rhem} and \emph{survival} \cite{survival-package} software.

\section{Results of Social Network Analysis across Regions}
\label{sec:res_sna}

\subsection{One-way ANOVAs for network statistics}
\label{sec:sna_anovas}

One of the goals of this work is to investigate whether there are significant differences between the different datasets in terms of network statistics. This knowledge might be used e.g. to assess the impact of different containment methods. One-way ANOVAs with multiple comparisons were used to identify significant differences between the networks derived from the datasets. Furthermore, descriptive statistics are given for all computed network statistics.

\paragraph{Degree centrality} Recall that degree centrality values are normalised; therefore comparison values derived from original publications are adjusted accordingly. Average values for the different regions were $0.0071\pm0.016$ for the Yunnan dataset ($1.345\pm3.187$ reported in the original publication \cite{hainan_publication}; $0.0079\pm0.018$ adjusted for normalisation), $0.0093\pm0.011$ for the Hainan dataset ($1.51\pm1.79$ reported in the original publication \cite{hainan_publication}; $0.0093\pm0.011$ adjusted for normalisation), $0.0043\pm0.0056$ for the Shaanxi dataset ($0.987\pm1.351$ reported in the original publication \cite{shaanxi_publication}; $0.0041\pm0.0057$ adjusted for normalisation), $0.00036\pm0.00067$ for the Xi'an dataset ($0.741\pm1.379$ in the original publication \cite{xian_publication}; $0.00036\pm0.00067$ adjusted for normalisation), $1.80\cdot 10^{-5}\pm6.84\cdot 10^{-5}$ for the China dataset (no data reported in the original publication), and $7.9\cdot 10^{-6}\pm1.4\cdot 10^{-5}$ for the Bucharest dataset (no data reported in the original publication). Therefore, values could reliably be reproduced where applicable, assuming some loss of precision.

Taking into account that values only include four digits after the decimal point and the resulting loss of information, values could reliably be reproduced where applicable.

\paragraph{Average shortest path length} Average values for the different regions were $0.25\pm0.39$ for the Yunnan dataset, $0.45\pm0.47$ for the Hainan dataset, $0.52\pm0.56$ for the Shaanxi dataset, $0.61\pm0.80$ for the Xi'an dataset, $0.32\pm0.51$ for the Bucharest dataset, and $0.24\pm0.67$ for the China dataset. Shortest path length was not analysed in any of the previous works, therefore there are no comparison values.

\subsection{Regression models for contact nomination likelihood}
\label{sec:sna_regression}

As briefly stated in chapter \ref{ch:methods}, ordinary least-squares regression was subsequently used to determine the influence of network statistics and actor covariates on contact nomination likelihood. To this end, for each dataset, all possible actor combinations were compiled into a dataset; each record contains network statistics and actor covariates of the source and target, and the absolute difference between source and target values for each variable. The regression model is fitted on the complete dataset, conditioned on whether there is a contact nomination seen in the actual underlying data (i.e. the original data presented in chapter \ref{ch:previous_work_data}). Therefore, the focus lies on explaining rather than predicting contact nominations. As covariates differ between the datasets, a different model was created for each dataset. The Xi'an dataset was excluded from this analysis, as it unfortunately does not include patient covariates.

\paragraph{Yunnan network} With a 95\% confidence interval, the statistically significant predictors for contact nomination likelihood are the sex of the nominator ($p<0.001$), sex discrepancy between nominator and nominee ($p<0.001$), whether the nominator is a family member of another actor in the dataset ($p<0.001$), and all network statistics for nominator, nominee, and the difference between nominator and nominee, with the exception of the average shortest path length of the nominator ($p=0.224$). Nominator sex has a marginally positive effect on contact nomination likelihood (coefficient = 0.0036); sex discrepancy has a marginally positive effect (coefficient = 0.0033); family member status of the nominator has a marginally positive effect (coefficient = 0.0036); degree centrality of nominator and nominee both have a marginally positive effect (coefficients = 0.0874 and 0.0901), while degree centrality discrepancy has a marginally negative effect (coefficient = -0.0880); betweenness centrality of nominator and nominee both have a marginally negative effect (coefficients = -0.0103 and -0.0114), while betweenness centrality discrepancy has a marginally positive effect (coefficient = 0.0182); pagerank centrality of the nominator has a marginally negative effect, the pagerank centrality of the nominee has a slightly positive effect, and pagerank centrality discrepancy has a marginally negative effect (coefficients = -0.0182, 0.172, and -0.0193, respectively); the component size of the nominator has a marginally negative effect, the component size of the nominee has a slightly positive effect, and component size discrepancy has a slightly negative effect (coefficients = -0.0350, 0.1101, and -0.1140, respectively); finally, the average shortest path length of the nominator has a marginally positive effect, the average shortest path length of the nominee has a marginally negative effect, and average shortest path length discrepancy has a marginally positive effect on contact nomination likelihood (coefficients = 0.0024, -0.0665, and 0.0702, respectively).

\section{Results of Relational Event Model Analysis across Regions}
\label{sec:res_rem}

All five main datasets (Yunnan, Hainan, Shaanxi, Bucharest and China) were analysed using relational event modelling. A varying number of non-events were sampled for each observed event, such that for each individual dataset, the total number of events would be around one million. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the significance and effect of computed statistics (which are listed in chapter \ref{ch:methods}) on contact nomination likelihood. Some of the statistics were all-zero in some datasets. The results of the Cox regressions will be presented below. For all datasets, three different sets of statistics and accompanying Cox proportional hazards models were computed. One with no conditioning, i.e. for any event $e(u,v,t_i)$, sampled non-events may include any other event $(u',v',t_i)$ which may have the same or a different source and the same or a different target, but not $u' = u \land v' = v$; one with source-specific conditioning, i.e. for any event $e(u,v,t_i)$, sampled non-events may only include those $e_s(u,v',t_i)$ which have the same source $u$, but another target $v'$; and one with target-specific conditioning, i.e. for any event $e(u,v,t_i)$, sampled non-events may only include those $e_s(u',v,t_i)$ which have the same target $v$, but another source $u'$. 

\paragraph{Yunnan network} With a 90\% confidence interval, the statistics that have a statistically significant impact on contact nomination likelihood are reciprocation ($p<0.0001$), the discrepancy between nominator's and nominee's age ($p<0.0001$), the sex of the nominee ($p=0.0302$), whether the nominee is a family member of another actor in the network ($p=0.0508$), and the discrepancy in family member status ($p<0.0001$). Reciprocation has a slightly positive effect on contact nomination likelihood (coefficient = 0.2434); age discrepancy has a marginally negative effect (coefficient = -0.0513), the sex of the nominee has a moderately positive effect (coefficient = 0.5077), the family member status of the nominee has a strongly negative effect (coefficient = -1.127), and the discrepancy in family member status has a very strongly negative effect (coefficient = -3.009).

\section{Results of Relational Hyperevent Model Analysis across Regions}
\label{sec:res_rhem}

Lastly, all five networks were analysed using relational hyperevent modelling much in the same fashion as outlined in section \ref{sec:res_rem}, main differences being 1) the network statistics and 2) the sampling conditioning; as with REM, three models were created for each network: one unconditioned, one source-conditioned, and one target-conditioned. In all models, observed events are only compared to possible non-events of the same size; this is necessary because contact tracing hyperevents always have only a single source. Without size constraints, an observed event $e(u,\{a,b,c\},t_i)$ might be compared to a possible event $e(\{a,b\},\{u,c\},t_i)$, which would be undesirable. Otherwise, unconditioned and conditioned models are largely the same as in REM, i.e. an observed hyperevent $e(h,t_i);\: h=(u,v)$ may be compared to a possible unobserved hyperevent $e(h',t_i);\: h'=(u',v');\: \lnot(u'=u \land v'=v)$ (unconditioned), $e(h',t_i);\: h'=(u,v')$ (source-conditioned), or $e(h',t_i);\: h'=(u',v)$ (target-conditioned).

\paragraph{Yunnan network} With a 90\% confidence interval, the statistics that have a statistically significant impact on contact nomination likelihood are just unordered partial repetition of third and fourth order (i.e. unordered partial repetitions on sets that contain three to four actors from the previous interaction) ($p<0.0001$ for both). Unordered partial repetition of third order has a marginally positive effect on contact nomination likelihood, while fourth order has a marginally negative effect (coefficients = 0.0326 and -0.0167, respectively).

\section{Discussion of Results}
\label{sec:res_discussion}

\subsection{Reproducibility of previous results}
\label{sec:discussion_repro}

One aim of this work is investigating whether results presented in previous research papers can reliably be reproduced using the same set of methods. As for the papers from Yang et al. \cite{hainan_publication,shaanxi_publication,xian_publication}, this has been shown to be the case, as can be seen in section \ref{sec:sna_anovas}. 

Regarding the paper by H\^ancean et al. \cite{hancean2022occupations}, things are not as clear. While the comparable network statistics (exact reciprocation, nominator in-degree, nominee out-degree, shared source and cyclical/transitive tie) are in agreement in terms of effect directionality, i.e. the sign of coefficient values, this is not the case for patient covariates (nominator age, nominees average age, age discrepancy, nominator sex, nominees average sex, sex discrepancy, nominator medical employment and nominees average medical employment). In particular, they determined nominator sex to be non-significant, while it was found to have a significantly positive effect here, across all three model variants; nominee average sex and sex discrepancy were reported to have a positive effect, while here they were found to have a negative effect across all model variants, with the exception of sex discrepancy in the target-conditioned model; finally, nominator medical employment and nominees average medical employment were both reported to be non-significant, whereas here both were found to be significantly negative across all three model variants \cite{hancean2022occupations}. For a full comparison, refer to table \ref{tab:rhem_repro_table}. This discrepancy in reported results is most likely due to the fact that in this work, the full dataset was included into the analysis, while H\^ancean et al. only included actors who had named/been named as a contact. Therefore, the dataset analysed in this work is far larger, which may well explain the discrepancy in results for the patient covariates; at the same time, the contact nomination records are the same in both cases, therefore the effect directionalities for the network statistics, e.g. reciprocation, are fully in agreement. However, the absolute coefficient values are mostly different in terms of magnitude, with the values reported by H\^ancean et al. generally being higher (e.g. -0.54 for nominee out-degree reported here (unconditioned model) vs -2.65 reported by H\^ancean et al. \cite{hancean2022occupations}). This difference may be due to either the size of the datasets, or different implementations, or both.

\subsection{Comparison of results between regions}
\label{sec:discussion_regions}

\paragraph{Social Network Analysis} Descriptive statistics for degree centrality show a negative association between network size and network density. Two possible explanations for this phenomenon are 1) that when the virus is still a rare occurrence and thus few people get infected, patients are more likely to know who would have infected them, and thus provide possible contacts (one caveat here is that this explanation assumes directionality in contact nomination, i.e. that patients nominate only possible sources of infection as opposed to sources as well as targets), and/or 2) that small sample sizes are more likely to show extremes, and that these tend to even out with a growing sample size (law of large numbers). Irrespective of the actual explanation, this phenomenon partly explains the ANOVA results for degree centrality, where all regions are pairwise different with the exception of Bucharest vs. China. Interesting to note is the fact that the Hainan network is significantly denser than the Yunnan region, which may be explained by Hainan's higher population density (290 vs. 120 per km$^2$) and status as a popular tourist region \cite{wiki_yunnan,wiki_hainan}. Reported values for pagerank centrality further support this.

The miniscule average values for betweenness centrality and corresponding ANOVA results suggest that infections very rarely spread in chains, and/or infection clusters tend to be isolated, i.e. two larger densely connected groups of cases are almost never connected to one another. This notion is further reinforced by the small mean values for shortest path length per node, meaning that connected nodes are very close to each other, and the mean/median values for connected component size.

\paragraph{OLS regression models} Comparable regressors across all regions are age, sex, and the five computed network statistics (i.e. degree centrality, betweenness centrality, pagerank centrality, component size and average shortest path length). 

The age of the nominator and nominee and age discrepancy are mostly insignificant, and directionality is not consistent across the instances with significance. Nominator age has a negative effect in the Shaanxi and China networks, i.e. younger people are more likely to nominate contacts. Nominee age has a negative effect in the Yunnan network, but a positive effect in the China network, i.e. in the Yunnan network, younger people are likewise more likely to be nominated as contacts, while the opposite is true for the China network. Age discrepancy has a negative effect in the Shaanxi and Bucharest network, while it has a positive effect in the China network. This means that in Bucharest and Shaanxi, nominator and nominee were more likely to be close in age (age homophily), while in China, nominator and nominee were more likely to be from different age groups. Overall, there is no clear tendency visible across all regions except for nominator age.

Sex paints a different picture, where nominator sex, nominee sex and sex discrepancy are significant in almost all instances (except nominee sex in Yunnan and all variations in Hainan) and all have a positive effect where significant, with the exception of sex discrepancy in Bucharest, which has a negative effect. This is misleading, however, since the coding for the Bucharest network differs from the others; there, it is male = 1 and female = 2, while for the other four networks, it is male = 1 and female = 0. Therefore, while a positive effect means that males are more likely to be a nominator/nominee in Yunnan, Hainan, Shaanxi and China, the opposite is the case for Bucharest. In conclusion, nominators are more likely to be males in Yunnan, Shaanxi and China; nominees are more likely to be males in Shaanxi and China; contact nominations are more likely to occur between different-sex actors (i.e. male to female or female to male) in Yunnan, Shaanxi, and China. In Bucharest, in contrast, nominators and nominees are more likely to be female, and contact nominations are more likely to occur between same-sex actors (i.e. male to male or female to female).

Nominator and nominee degree centrality have a positive effect across all regions, i.e. actors with a higher number of contacts are more likely to nominate/be nominated (which is obvious and self-explanatory). With the exception of Shaanxi, discrepancy in degree centrality also has a negative effect, i.e. nominations tend to happen between actors with a similar number of contacts, which suggests infections happening in densely connected clusters. 

Nominee betweenness centrality has a positive effect in all regions except Yunnan, while nominator betweenness centrality has a positive effect in Hainan and China and a negative effect in Yunnan, Shaanxi and Bucharest. This suggests that nominees are generally more likely to be information flow facilitators, while these facilitators are themselves less likely to nominate other people in Yunnan, Shaanxi and Bucharest and more likely in Hainan and China. This is paradoxical at first, as one would expect the former, but not the latter (e.g. image the scenario where $B$ is a facilitator of information between clusters $C_1$ and $C_2$. One would therefore expect that $B$ is more likely to be nominated by $A\in C_1$ as a contact, which is supported by the results mentioned above, and that $B$ is more likely to nominate $D\in C_2$, which is however not supported by the results.). However, recall that the network is  undirected; therefore, an actor $B$ who gets nominated by both $A$ and $D$ would also be considered a node with a high betweenness centrality while not necessarily acting as a facilitator of information, i.e. transmitting the virus from one cluster to another. As for discrepancy in betweenness centrality, there seems to be an inverted relationship with nominator betweenness centrality, i.e. where nominator betweenness centrality has a positive effect, discrepancy between nominator and nominee has a negative effect, and vice versa. This means that nominations go from facilitators to non-facilitators, and vice versa, which would be the expected behaviour.

Effects of pagerank centrality vastly differ between regions, with no clear tendency or pattern. Interestingly, there seems to be no correlation with degree centrality. With the exception of Bucharest, nominees are more likely to have a larger component size, while nominator component size has a positive effect in Shaanxi and China and a negative effect in Yunnan and Bucharest. In all regions, component size discrepancy has a negative effect. This suggests that contact nominations tend to occur between actors who are part of similarly sized components (i.e. infection clusters). This makes sense, since a connected component is a community of nodes who are densely interconnected, but are isolated from the rest of the network, i.e. contact nominations always happen between nodes of the same component.

While effect directionality of nominator/nominee average shortest path length and discrepancy in average shortest path length differ across regions, it is always the case that both nominator and nominee average shortest path length have the same directionality, and discrepancy the opposite directionality of that, i.e. if nominator average shortest path length has a positive effect, so does nominee, and discrepancy has a negative effect, and vice versa. That means that when nominator and nominee tend to have longer shortest paths to other nodes, actors with similar average shortest path lengths tend to nominate each other, but when nominator and nominee tend to have shorter paths to other nodes, actors with different average shortest path lengths nominate each other.

\paragraph{Relational event models} Comparable regressors across all regions are age, sex, and the computed network statistics (i.e. nomination activity, reciprocation, exact repetition, exact reciprocation, transitive tie, cyclical tie, shared source, and shared target). Recall that for relational (hyper-)event models, there are three variants for each region: unconditioned, source-conditioned and target-conditioned. As laid out in chapter \ref{ch:methods}, the partial likelihood of any event $e$ at time $t$ is equal to the hazard rate $\lambda_e$ of e, divided by the sum over the hazard rates $\lambda_{e_i}$ of all potential events that could happen at time $t$, i.e. the risk set. In the unconditioned model, this risk set is equal to the events on all possible combinations of actors. In the source-conditioned case, the risk set is constrained to those possible events that have the same source as $e$, but any target (i.e. the probability of different targets is modelled), and in the target-conditioned case, the risk set is constrained to those possible events that have the same target as $e$, but any source (i.e. the probability of different sources is modelled). Therefore, source-specific statistics, i.e. statistics that are exclusively a function of the source (e.g. nomination activity, nominator age), can not be included into the discussion of source-conditioned model results, and target-specific statistics can not be included into the discussion of target-conditioned model results (e.g. nominee age). However, they are included in the result tables presented in this chapter for sake of completeness. 

For the unconditioned models, directions of effects are mostly in agreement across the five regions, at least where statistically significant. Reciprocation is significant in four of five regions with the exception of Hainan, and has a positive effect in three of four cases, with the exception of Bucharest. This means that actors who have been nominated as a contact are more likely to themselves appear as a nominator at a later time. This is intuitive, as people who have come into contact with a Covid-positive patient are likely to have contracted the virus themselves, and therefore be listed as a patient (i.e. a nominator) at a later time. In the two cases where exact reciprocation is significant (Bucharest and China), it too has a positive effect. This means that nominees are even likely to "return the favour" and now nominate their nominator from a previous interaction as a nominee. Shared source and cyclical tie also have a positive effect where significant (Bucharest and China), meaning that nominees who have been nominated by the same actor are likely to interact, i.e. nominate each other, at a later time (which is intuitive; imagine e.g. a party, where one of the attendees has become ill and given all other guests as contacts. It would be sensible to assume that he has infected others at the party, thus some of the guests would interact with each other in a future contact nomination event), and that there might be a tendency for the virus to "go around" (e.g. person $A$ tests positive and nominates their barber, who nominates a friend of $A$ who frequents the same barber, and that friend again nominates $A$ who he has met for a drink in the meantime). Of course, all of these interpretations are subject to the caveat that the semantic of the direction of interactions (i.e. whether the nominator names a potential source for his infection, or someone who he could have infected) is not clear from the data. As for age, nominator and nominee age have a negative effect in two (Hainan, Bucharest) out of three (Hainan, Bucharest, China) regions where significant, meaning that nominator and nominee are more likely to be younger people in Hainan and Bucharest, and the opposite for China. Age discrepancy has a negative effect in three out of three significant cases (Yunnan, Hainan and Bucharest), which means that nominator and nominee tend to be of similar age in these regions. Nominator sex is mostly insignificant, but shows a trend towards women where it is (Bucharest and China). Nominee sex shows a bias towards men in Yunnan and Hainan, and a bias towards women in Bucharest and China. Finally, sex discrepancy has a positive effect in Shaanxi, Bucharest and China, meaning nominator and nominee tend to be of opposite sex. 

As for the source-conditioned models, exact reciprocation tells a similar story, having a positive effect in two out of two significant regions (Bucharest and China). This means that for a specific interaction source $u$, the most likely target is an actor who previously nominated $u$. Cyclical tie has a positive effect in Bucharest and negative in China, showing no clear tendency either way. Shared source has a positive effect in Bucharest and China, which goes hand in hand with the explanation given above. Nominee age has a negative effect in Hainan and Bucharest, and a positive effect in China, meaning a nominator $u$ will select a young (old) actor as his most likely target in these regions. Age discrepancy is negative in four out of four cases (all except Shaanxi), which suggests a nominator $u$ chooses a nominee who is close to himself in age. Nominee sex has a positive effect in Yunnan and Bucharest, i.e. a nominator $u$ is more likely to nominate males in Yunnan, and females in Bucharest (remember that in Bucharest, male = 1 and female = 2). Finally, sex discrepancy has a positive effect in Shaanxi, Bucharest and China, meaning that a nominator $u$ preferably chooses a nominee who is of the opposite sex. These results largely corroborate the ones found in the unconditioned model.

Finally, for the target-conditioned models, reciprocation is largely insignificant (only significant in Bucharest), and exact reciprocation has a positive effect in Bucharest and China, meaning that a specific nominee $v$ is most likely to get nominated by an actor whom he has named as a contact himself at a previous time. Shared source also has a positive effect in Bucharest and China, which again supports the previous explanation. Nominator age has a negative effect in two (Hainan and Bucharest) out of three (Hainan, Bucharest and China) significant cases, meaning that a specific nominee $v$ is most likely to get nominated by a young (old) actor in these regions. Age discrepancy has a negative effect in all regions except Shaanxi, meaning that $v$ is most likely to be targeted by an actor close in age. Finally, sex discrepancy has a positive effect across all three significant cases (Shaanxi, Bucharest and China), meaning that a specific nominee $v$ is most likely to be nominated by an actor of the opposite sex. While less statistics are relevant here compared to the other two model variants, the effects of those that are significant mostly correspond to those of the other models. Overall, there is a moderate difference between regions in terms of which statistics have a significant effect, but the regions are similar in terms of effect directionality.

\paragraph{Relational hyperevent models} Comparable regressors across all regions are age, sex, and the computed network statistics (i.e. nominee size, exact repetition, unordered repetition, partial repetition, unordered partial repetition, reciprocation, nominator in-degree, nominee out-degree, transitive tie, cyclical tie, shared source and shared target). Again, there are three model variants for each region similar to REM, the main difference being that in the case of target-conditioning, the whole target set is fixed rather than only a single target actor. 

For the unconditioned model, the size of the nominee set is significant and has a positive effect only in Bucharest and China, i.e. nomination events where a large number of contacts is named have a greater likelihood to occur there. Partial repetition is mostly insignificant. Unordered partial repetition is seldom significant, and only shows a clear tendency across regions in the cases of first and fourth order: first-order unordered partial repetition has a positive effect in two (Shaanxi and China) out of three (Shaanxi, Bucharest and China) significant regions, meaning that nominations are more likely to occur in Shaanxi and China when one of the actors has already been part of previous nominations, either as patient or named contact, and less likely to occur in Bucharest. Exact reciprocation has a positive effect only in Bucharest and China, meaning that there is a tendency for nominees of previous nomination events to "return the favour", i.e. nominate, among others, the nominator of the previous interaction. Nominator in-degree is only significant in Bucharest and China, with a negative effect in Bucharest and a positive effect in China. This means that in Bucharest, nominees of previous interactions are less likely to appear as nominators in future interactions, and the opposite is true for China. Nominee out-degree has a negative effect in both of these regions, i.e. contact nomination events where some of the nominees have acted as nominators in previous events are more likely to occur. Cyclical tie and shared source are both only significant in Bucharest and China, and have a positive effect in Bucharest and a negative effect in China. This suggests a tendency for the virus to "go around" and nominees to nominate each other in future events for Bucharest, and the opposite for China. Nominator age and average age of nominees only have a significant effect in Bucharest and China; nominator age has a positive effect in both cases, meaning that contact nominations are more likely to occur when the nominator is old; the average age of nominees has a negative effect in Bucharest, meaning that nominees tend to be younger, while the opposite is true for China. Age discrepancy has a negative effect in three out of three significant regions (Shaanxi, Bucharest and China), meaning that contact nominations tend to be between nominators and nominees of similar age. Intuitively, one would expect a positive effect in Bucharest as nominators tend to be of higher age and nominees tend to be of lower age and thus the discrepancy would be expected to be higher. Discrepancy in age among nominees plays no role across regions. Nominator and nominee average sex are only significant in Bucharest and China, nominator sex having a positive effect in Bucharest and a negative effect in China, meaning that nomination events are more likely when the nominator is female (remember female = 2 and male = 1 in Bucharest, opposed to female = 0 and male = 1 in the other datasets), and average sex of nominees having a negative effect in both cases, i.e. there is a tendency towards contact nominations where the nominee set is majority male in Bucharest, and where nominees are majority female in China. Sex discrepancy between nominator and nominees has a positive effect in two (Shaanxi, China) out of three (Shaanxi, Bucharest, China) significant regions. This means that males tend to nominate more females than males, and vice versa, in Shaanxi and China, while there is sex homophily in Bucharest. Also, nominees in Shaanxi and China tend to be heterogeneous in terms of sex, while they tend to be homogeneous in Bucharest. 

For the source-conditioned model, the size of the nominee set has a negative effect in three (Yunnan, Hainan and Shaanxi) out of five regions. This means that a specific actor $u$ will likely only name few contacts in Yunnan, Hainan and Shaanxi, while the opposite is true for Bucharest and China. It is possible that this is due to the comparably small size of the former three datasets. Unordered partial repetition up to an order of three has a positive effect across most regions, i.e. an actor $u$ is likely to nominate contacts of which up to three have been part of previous interactions.  Interestingly, fourth-order unordered partial repetition has a negative effect in two out of two (Hainan and China) significant regions. This may suggest that there is a limit on how many actors co-appear at multiple occasions. Nominee out-degree has a negative effect in two (Bucharest and China) out of three (Yunnan, Bucharest and China) significant regions, i.e. nominators of previous contact nominations are less likely to be named as nominees in Bucharest and China, and more likely in Yunnan. Exact reciprocation has a positive effect in both Bucharest and China, which means that if a nominator $u$ was a nominee in a previous interaction, he is likely to name the nominator of that previous interaction as a contact in a future interaction. Cyclical tie has a positive effect in Bucharest and China, which might mean actors tend to pass the virus around in circles. Shared source has a positive effect in Bucharest and a negative effect in China, showing no clear tendency. The average age of nominees has a positive effect in two (Yunnan and China) out of three (Yunnan, Hainan and China) significant regions, i.e. a specific actor $u$ tends to nominate older contacts in Yunnan and China, and younger ones in Hainan. Discrepancy in age between nominator and nominees has a negative effect across all five regions, meaning that nominators $u$ tend to name contacts who are of similar age. The average sex of nominees has a negative effect in two (Bucharest and China) out of three (Yunnan, Bucharest and China) significant regions, i.e. nominators tend to name majority male contacts in Yunnan and Bucharest and majority female contacts in China. Sex discrepancy between nominator and nominees shows a clear tendency towards heterophily across most regions. Sex discrepancy among nominees is only significant in two regions (Bucharest and China), with no clear tendency either way. 

Finally, for the target-conditioned model, exact reciprocation, shared source and nominator in-degree are significant only in Bucharest and China, and show no clear tendency towards positive or negative effect. Cyclical tie is significant in Bucharest and China and has a positive effect in both cases, meaning that for a fixed nominee set, the nominator is most likely to be an actor such that the contact nomination constitutes a circular transmission to a previous case (assuming that contact nominations are possible viral transmissions from source to targets, semantically speaking). Nominator age has a positive effect across three out of three significant regions (Yunnan, Bucharest and China), meaning that in these regions, a specific nominee set is most likely to be nominated by an older patient. Discrepancy in age between nominator and nominees has a negative effect in all regions except Shaanxi, i.e. any specific nominee set is most likely to be nominated by a nominator of similar age. Nominator sex only has a significant effect in Bucharest and China, and shows no clear tendency. Sex discrepancy has a positive effect in Yunnan, Bucharest and China, which means that female majority nominee sets tend to get nominated by males, and vice versa in these regions. Overall, there is no strong similarity in terms of significance, and a moderate similarity in terms of effect directionality; in particular, many statistics are insignificant or all-zero in the smaller datasets (Yunnan, Hainan and Shaanxi), which unfortunately limits the meaningfulness of these comparisons.

\subsection{Comparison of results between methods}
\label{sec:discussion_methods}

\paragraph{Yunnan network} While none of the OLS regression, relational event- and relational hyperevent models (and their variants) find a consistent effect for nominator or nominee age, REM and RHEM variants consistently produce a negative effect for age discrepancy between nominator and nominee(s), i.e. a tendency for age homophily, while OLS regression finds no significance for this effect (although the reported coefficient is also negative). To test whether this is due to side effects, it would be prudent to fit separate models for actor covariates and network statistics in a future work. Overall, these findings suggest nominator and nominee age play no role on their own, but only when set in relation to one another, in the sense that nominator and nominee(s) tend to be of similar age.

Regarding sex, there is no clear picture across models whatsoever. Nominator sex is only significant in the OLSR model, and effect directionality is inconsistent even when not considering significance. Nominee sex is insignificant in OLSR and unconditioned RHEM, but coefficients are consistently positive. Sex discrepancy between nominator and nominees is completely insignificant in all REM variants; in OLSR and RHEM, coefficients are positive across variants, i.e. there is a tendency for sex heterophily. Overall, nominator sex seems to only play a role when set in relation to nominee sex (sex discrepancy), while nominee sex plays a role even when viewed isolated, in the sense that nominees are more likely to be males than females.

Whether the nominator is a family member of another actor in the dataset has a positive effect across all models and their variants, although the effect is not significant in the applicable relational event models (there is no definitive interpretation of this insignificance). No clear tendency is obvious for the nominees; it's only relevant in applicable REM, and has a negative effect there, i.e. homophily. Discrepancy in this relationship status, however, has a negative effect across all models (although insignificant in OLSR and unconditioned RHEM). These findings, i.e. homophily between nominator and nominees, combined with the fact that nominators tend to be relatives of other actors in the network, suggest that contact nominations tend to be mostly among family members here, or at least that there are seldom contact nominations between a family and an unaffiliated individual.

The network statistics included in the OLS regression model are not comparable to those included in REM and RHEM. Therefore, only the results of REM and RHEM and their variants are compared here. Except for general reciprocation (i.e. nominator in-degree for RHEM), none of these are statistically significant in any of the model variants. As for the case of reciprocation, it has a positive effect in REM, and a negative, albeit insignificant one in RHEM. This means that in REM, actors who have been nominated as contacts in the past are more likely to become patients themselves in the future. On paper, the results for RHEM suggest the opposite, but their lack of statistical significance makes this conclusion somewhat doubtful.

In terms of model fit, $R^2$ is $0.591$ for OLS regression, $0.0062/0.088/0.096$ for un/source/target-conditioned REM, and $0.00006/0.00023/0.015$ for un/source/target-conditioned RHEM, i.e. the SNA model seems to be suited best for this network, and target-conditioned variants perform better than un- and source-conditioned R(H)EM.

\paragraph{Hainan network} Things are a bit more uniform here. Most noteworthy perhaps is that one the one hand, OLS regression fails to find any significant actor covariate except whether the nominee has relatives in the network, and on the other, REM and RHEM fail to find any significant network effects. Without considering significance, most effects are in agreement across methods in terms of directionality, with the exception of nominator and nominee age and discrepancy in having family members in the network. Nominator and nominee age is only significant in REM variants, where a negative coefficient tells us that both nominators and nominees tend to be younger actors; this is the case in RHEM as well, but effects there are not statistically significant except for nominee age in the source-conditioned model, so comparability is not assured. Interestingly, the OLS regression model finds a positive effect for these covariates, but these too are insignificant, and thus, it's unclear whether this is an actual contradiction. Age discrepancy is mostly significant and has a negative effect in all cases, showing a clear tendency towards age homophily. These findings suggest that nominator and nominees tend to be of a similar, younger age; young people seldom nominate old ones, and vice versa.

The nominator's sex is insignificant in all models, and there's no obvious bias towards either sex. The sex of the nominee is only significant in the unconditioned REM variant, but has a positive effect in all instances. The same is true for sex discrepancy, except that it's insignificant in all models. Without regard to statistical significance, one would interpret these results such that sex does not play an important role for becoming a nominator, but that nominees are more likely to be males, and there is sex heterophily, i.e. men tend to nominate women and vice versa. The fact that these statistics are mostly insignificant across the different methods and model variants, however, suggests that sex plays no important role in this network whatsoever. 

Where significant, family member presence has a positive effect for both nominator and nominees, while discrepancy has a negative effect in all cases except in OLSR (again, not significant). These findings suggest that nominators and nominees tend to have family members in the network, and also that contact nominations happen either among family members or among individuals who have no relatives present in the network. 

$R^2$ is $0.125$ for OLS regression, $0.0008/0.0083/0.016$ for un/source/target-conditioned REM, and $0.00003/0.00019/0.017$ for un/source/target-conditioned RHEM. 

\paragraph{Shaanxi network} Here, nominator age and age discrepancy have a negative effect across all instances, but are insignificant in applicable REM and RHEM variants in the case of nominator age, and REMs in the case of age discrepancy. Nominee age also only has a significantly negative effect in the OLS regression model, while REM and RHEM variants report an insignificantly positive effect. Overall, model results suggest that both nominators and nominees tend to be of a younger age, and also prefer to nominate actors of similar age. Again, the meaningfulness of this interpretation is limited due to statistical insignificances.

Nominator sex is only found to be significant in OLS regression and the unconditioned REM model, but shows no bias to either sex (positive effect in OLSR, negative effect in REM). Nominee sex, on the other hand, shows a clear tendency towards males (albeit not significant in REM/RHEM variants), and sex discrepancy has a significantly positive effect in all instances except the target-conditioned RHEM. According to these results, no meaningful conclusion can be drawn regarding the influence of actor sex on the likelihood to become a nominator; however, sex has a clear influence on nominees, i.e. a tendency for nominees to be male, and there is strong evidence for sex heterophily, i.e. male nominators tending to name females as contacts, and vice versa. 

There is also a clear tendency for nominators and nominees to have family members in the network (positive effects across all models with few insignificances). Interestingly, OLS regression and all REM variants find a positive effect for discrepancy (albeit insignificant in the latter case), i.e. a tendency for contact nominations between one actor with relatives in the network, and one actor without relatives in the network. RHEM results for this effect are insignificant and show no clear trend. This finding is counter-intuitive, especially when taking into consideration that both nominators and nominees tend to be people who have relatives in the network. But again, drawing a definitive conclusion is difficult due to insignificances.

Although the place of residence of nominator and nominee(s) was included in all models, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from these results. This is because distinct places of residence were just translated into integer labels, and were neither sorted in a meaningful way, nor transformed into a one-hot-encoding scheme (e.g. into variables \emph{lives in Beijing, lives in Shanghai} etc.). Therefore, only the discrepancy in place of residence between nominator and nominee(s) is of interest here. There is strong and clear evidence of homophily across all models (significant negative effects), meaning that contact nominations tend to be among actors hailing from the same municipality. 

Reciprocation is the only significant network effect, and only in unconditioned and source-conditioned relational event models. Positive coefficients suggest a tendency for previously nominated contacts to become positive cases in future interactions.

$R^2$ is $0.107$ for OLS regression, $0.00054/0.014/0.019$ for un/source/target-conditioned REM, and $0.00065/0.0026/0.017$ for un/source/target-conditioned RHEM.

\paragraph{Bucharest network} The first thing of notice is that there are way more statistically significant findings here, compared to the previously discussed networks. Overall, effect directionalities are mostly in agreement across models, with a few notable exceptions. Nominator and nominee(s) age has no significant effect in OLS regression, but a significantly negative one in REM and a significantly positive one in RHEM. This suggests that there is a higher-order effect, which is missed by the dyadic relational event models. When individual nominations are analysed independently, nominators have a tendency to be of younger age; however, the opposite is the case when contact nominations are taken as a whole (i.e. as hyperevents). For the age of nominee(s), significant effects are all negative (in applicable REM variants, and unconditioned RHEM), and age discrepancy is negative across all models and their respective variants, suggesting that nominees generally tend to be of younger age, and nominators and nominees tend to be of similar age, i.e. there is age homophily. 

Nominator sex shows a significant and positive effect in all instances, i.e. a tendency for nominators to be women (recall the different coding scheme); nominee sex is significantly positive in OLSR and applicable REM variants, and negative in applicable RHEM variants. This also suggests a higher-order effect missed by dyadic models. Sex discrepancy is also significant in all cases, but there is no clear tendency to be found (negative effect in OLSR and two out of three RHEM variants, positive in the rest). The only conclusion that can be drawn for certain here is that nominators tend to be females rather than males. Assuming RHEM are best suited to analyse these interactions (in theory, they should be, as they are designed specifically to analyse multicast interactions), one may additionally conclude that nominees tend to be male, and that there is sex heterophily, i.e. nominators tend to be women, who tend to nominate men as contacts.

There is full agreement across all models and their respective variants regarding nominator and nominee(s) employment in the medical field, and discrepancy thereof between nominator and nominee(s). In particular, nominator and nominee(s) medical employment status has a significant and negative effect in all instances, and discrepancy has a significantly positive effect in all instances. We can therefore find that actors employed in the medical field actually are less likely to become patients or be named as possible contacts, and in the case that they should act as either one, they tend to nominate/be nominated by people who are not active in the medical field.

Nominator and nominee job titles were translated into integer labels in a similar fashion as places of residence were in the Shaanxi and China networks; therefore, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn based upon their respective results. As for job discrepancy, OLS regression finds heterophily, i.e. a tendency for contact nominations to occur between actors with different jobs, while according to REM/RHEM results, the opposite is the case.

General and exact reciprocation is negative/positive in all REM and RHEM variants, respectively (with the exception of exact reciprocation/unconditioned REM, where it is not statistically significant). These findings (counter-intuitively) suggest that actors who have been named as contacts in the past are less likely to become patients in future interactions, but at the same time are likely to return contact nominations at a later point in time. A possible interpretation is that nominees are unlikely to re-appear as contact nominators in general, except for the case where they nominate their previous nominator in return.

Cyclical tie and shared source are significantly positive in all REM and RHEM variants (except cyclical tie/target-conditioned REM, where it is insignificant). This means that there is a tendency for nominees of a previous interaction to name each other as contacts in a future interaction, and a tendency for the virus to be passed around in circles (assuming a fixed semantic of contact nomination directionality).

$R^2$ is $0.888$ for OLS regression, $0.0058/0.0025/0.022$ for un/source/target-conditioned REM, and $0.045/0.036/0.014$ for un/source/target-conditioned RHEM.

\paragraph{China network} Most computed statistics were found to have a significant effect here, as well. As we will see, for the majority of statistics, all or at least most models and their variants are in agreement in terms of significance and effect direction. But there are a few cases where findings differ, specifically age and sex. 

While OLS regression finds a negative effect for nominator age and a positive effect for age discrepancy between nominator and nominee(s), i.e. a tendency for nominators to be younger, and a tendency for age heterophily, REM and RHEM variants find the opposite, i.e. a tendency for nominators to be older, and a tendency for age homophily. As for age of the nominee(s), all models find a positive effect, i.e. nominees tend to be older actors. Regarding sex, OLSR finds a positive effect for nominator and nominee, i.e. a bias towards males in both roles, while REM and RHEM variants find a negative effect, i.e. a bias towards females in these roles. Results are consistent across models only for sex discrepancy, where a positive effect, i.e. sex heterophily, is reported. These results suggest that there are time-specific higher-order effects for these covariates in the network.

The other actor covariates (place of residence, place/occasion of infection, symptoms, symptom severity and place of registration with health authorities) are all categorical variables and suffer from the same limitations outlined in the discussions of the Shaanxi and Bucharest networks, i.e. no meaningful encodings of values. Thus, we can only establish that all of these have a significant effect on both nominator and nominee(s), but can make no statement regarding the directions/semantics of those effects. We can, however, investigate the effects of discrepancies between nominator and nominee(s). OLS regression finds a positive effect for discrepancy in place of residence, i.e. a tendency for nominator and nominee(s) to hail from different municipalities, while REM and RHEM find the opposite, i.e. a tendency for contact nominations to occur between residents of the same municipality (which seems more intuitive, as China had imposed harsh lockdown measures during the respective time frame). All models find a negative effect for discrepancy in place and/or occasion where actors got infected, i.e. there's a tendency for contact nominations between actors who got infected at the same place or during the same activity. Similarly, and corroborating these interpretations, there's a negative effect for discrepancy in the place where actors were admitted to health authorities, i.e. there's a tendency for nominator and nominee(s) to be registered as positive in the same municipality. Regarding actor symptoms, all models find a negative effect for symptom discrepancy, i.e. nominator and nominee(s) tend to suffer from similar symptoms; there are no such consistent findings regarding symptom severity, however.

As for network effects, both REM and RHEM mostly find a positive effect for general and exact reciprocation, i.e. previous contact nominations of an actor increase the chance for that actor to become a patient in a future interaction, and also to name his previous nominator as a contact. There is no consistency between models for cyclical tie, but there is a contradiction between REM and RHEM concerning the shared source effect. All REM variants find a positive effect (i.e. nominees tend to nominate each other in future interactions), while all RHEM variants find a negative effect (i.e. nominees tend not to nominate each other in future interactions), again hinting at a higher-order effect specific to multi-cast interactions.

$R^2$ is $0.927$ for OLS regression, $0.13/0.12/0.12$ for un/source/target-conditioned REM, and $0.046/0.039/0.031$ for un/source/target-conditioned RHEM.

\section{Conclusion}

Analysis of the effects of actor covariates on contact nominations show that age and sex play a significant and mostly consistent role in all regions. Nominators and nominees tend to be of a similar and younger age, and contact nominations tend occur between individuals of opposite sex. As for the network effects, infections tend to happen in tight-knit clusters rather than in long stretched chains. The general lack of repetition and shared target effects in REM and RHEM suggest that actors, once they have appeared as a Covid-positive nominator, don't fall ill again afterwards. Reciprocation and shared source effects suggest that individuals who have been named as contacts are likely to be registered as positive cases in the future, and in that case tend to then nominate other actors whom they have been co-nominated with in the original interaction. 

When only taking $R^2$ values into consideration, social network analysis models fit the data best in all instances; one might therefore conclude that SNA is the best approach to analysing case contact networks. However, the insight that can be gained from those network models is limited. They are very useful for identifying important actors in the network (e.g. so-called superspreaders, i.e. persons who are especially infectious), but it's hard to identify specific dynamics in interactions between actors. Relational event- and hyperevent models are more suited for this task. They can be used to discover patterns in interactions, e.g. whether the same actors tend to be part of multiple events. Therefore, there can be no definitive recommendation for either static or dynamic models; rather, they should be used for different tasks. 

Regarding the question of REM vs RHEM, $R^2$ values give us no clear answer. In general, these models performed fairly poorly on the three smaller networks of Yunnan, Hainan and Shaanxi, which suggests they are not well-suited for the application to small datasets. Looking at the larger networks of Bucharest and China, REM variants performed better on the China network, and RHEM variants performed better on the Bucharest network. However, results showed some discrepancies between REM and RHEM regarding network and covariate effects in some instances, suggesting that there are indeed higher-order effects to be found in the data, which would be missed by dyadic interaction models.
