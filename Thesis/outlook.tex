There are a few limitations to this work which might be addressed in a possible future work. For one, we have seen the issue of statistical (in)significance and the resulting problems when comparing effects between models and regions. As suggested, it would be prudent to divide the combined ordinary least-squares regression, relational event and relation hyperevent models into additional sub-models for actor and network effects to check for possible model-specific side effects. Regarding the data used in this work, with the exception of the China network, all datasets only cover a comparably short timespan. This limits the usefulness of time-dynamic models like REM and RHEM, as actors are very unlikely to appear multiple times in such short time. This is supported by the fact that repetition statistics were found to have played hardly any role in interaction dynamics. Therefore, it would be interesting to conduct a longitudinal study covering a larger time frame, perhaps on a disease like the common cold, where people are more likely to become ill more than once. Lastly, this work is in no means exhaustive. In particular, other network effects that have not been included into the models used here may very well play an important role. While including all possible effects would have surpassed the scope of this work, they should definitely be addressed in future works.
